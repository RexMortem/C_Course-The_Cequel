# Session 2 - The Cequel

Welcome to the Cequel! 
<small> See what I did there </small>

I hope you enjoyed Session 1 and are now comfortable with using variables, for loops, and if statements to create very basic C programs (including commenting and being able to compile your code), and are familiar with undefined behaviour and arrays - we can now start to explore  

It's getting to the harder stuff ...

Good luck and happy coding!S
